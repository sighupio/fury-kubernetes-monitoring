# Alertmanager Operated

Alertmanager handles alerts sent by Prometheus server and routes them to
configured receiver integrations such as email, Slack, PageDuty, or OpsGenie. It
helps you to manage alerts flexibly with its grouping, inhibition
and silencing features.

Fury Prometheus deployment (see [prometheus-operated](../prometheus-operated))
is already configured to automatically discover Alertmanager instances deployed
with this package.
