# HAproxy Package

This package provides a Grafana Dashboard and a set of alert rules for the prometheus exporter built in HAproxy v2 (and not the `haproxy_exporter`).

To use this package to monitor an HAproxy battery *outside* the cluster you must:

1. Check that your haproxy has been built with the built-in prometheus exporter enabled:

```bash
haproxy -vvv | grep prometheus
```

2. Enable a frontend on HAproxy that exposes the metrics:

```haproxyconfig
frontend prometheus
  bind :8405
  mode http
  http-request use-service prometheus-exporter
  no log
```

3. Create a `ScrapeConfig` object to make Prometheus scrape the metrics from the HAproxy hosts:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: ScrapeConfig
metadata:
  name: haproxy-lb
  namespace: monitoring
  labels:
    prometheus: k8s
spec:
  staticConfigs:
    - labels:
        job: prometheus
      targets:
        - haproxy01.mydomain:8405
        - haproxy02.mydomain:8405
```
