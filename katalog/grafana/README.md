## Requirements

## Configuration

Fury distribution Grafana is deployed with the following configuration:

- Replica number: `1`
- Anonymous authentication enabled
- `Admin` role for unauthenticated users
- Resource limits are `200m` for CPU and `200Mi` for memory
- Listens on port `3000`
- Prometheus configured as the data source

## Add new dashboards

You can create a Configmap in your project with a JSON of a grafana dashboard
and then labeling it with the label key `grafana-sighup-dashboard`, the value
of the label is up to you (for mental healthiness should be better than the
value respects some sort of reference with the project to with the dashboard is
related). Labeling it, the sidecar k8s-sidecar will take care of it and inject
it into a shared volume where grafana does a lookup and discover it.
Look at the [dashboards](dashboards) folder kustomization.yml for an example.

## Deployment

You can deploy Grafana by running the following command in the root of the project:

```shell
kustomize build | kubectl apply -f -
```

### Accessing Grafana UI

You can access Grafana Dashboard by port-forwarding on port `3000`:

```shell
kubectl port-forward svc/grafana 3000:3000 --namespace monitoring
```

Grafana will be available on [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000) from
