# Kubeadm ServiceMonitor

This package provides monitoring for the following Kubernetes components:

- kubelet
- coredns
- api-server
- kube-control-manager
- kube-scheduler
- etcd

These are components needed to deliver a functioning Kubernetes cluster. If you
want to learn more about these components please follow the official
[documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/) of
Kubernetes.


## Requirements

- Kubernetes >= `1.17.0`
- Kustomize = `v3.3.0`
- [prometheus-operator](../prometheus-operator)


## Configuration

Prometheus scrapes Kubernetes component metrics on port `metrics` with following
intervals:
- kube-control-manager: `30s`
- coredns: `15s`
- etcd: `15s`
- api-server: `30s`
- kubelet: `30s`
- kube-scheduler: `30s`
- Dashboards shipped:
  - `coredns`: CoreDNS < 1.7.0
  - `api-server`: Kubernetes / API server
  - `cluster-total`: Kubernetes / Networking / Cluster
  - `kubelet`: Kubernetes / Kubelet
  - `namespace-by-pod`: Kubernetes / Networking / Namespace (Pods)
  - `namespace-by-workload`: Kubernetes / Networking / Namespace (Workload)
  - `persistent-volumes-usage`: Kubernetes / Persistent Volumes
  - `pod-total`: Kubernetes / Networking / Pod
  - `workload-total`: Kubernetes / Networking / Workload
  - `controller-manager`: Kubernetes / Controller Manager
  - `etcd`: Etcd
  - `scheduler`: Kubernetes / Scheduler
