# Prometheus Operated

<!-- <KFD-DOCS> -->

Prometheus Operated deploys Prometheus instances via Prometheus CRD as defined
by [Prometheus Operator](../prometheus-operator).

Prometheus is a monitoring tool to collect metric based time series data and
provides a functional expression language that lets the user select and
aggregate time-series data in real-time. Prometheus's expression browser makes it
possible to analyze queried data as a graph or view it as tabular data, but it's
also possible to integrate it with third-party time-series analytics tools like
Grafana. Grafana integration is provided in Fury monitoring katalog, please see
[Grafana](../grafana) package's documentation.

## Requirements

- Kubernetes >= `1.20.0`
- Kustomize = `v3.3.X`
- [prometheus-operator](../prometheus-operator)

## Image repository and tag

* Prometheus image: `registry.sighup.io/prometheus/prometheus:v2.32.1`
* Prometheus repository: [Prometheus on Github][prom-gh]
* Prometheus documentation: [Prometheus Homepage][prom-doc]

## Configuration

Fury distribution Prometheus is deployed with the following configuration:

- Replica number: `1`
- Retention for `30` days
- Requires `150Gi` storage(with default storage type of Provider)
- Listens on port `9090`
- Alert manager endpoint set to `alertmanager-main`

## Deployment

You can deploy Prometheus Operated by running the following command in the root of
the project:

```shell
kustomize build | kubectl apply -f -
```

To learn how to customize it for your needs please see the
[examples](../../examples) folder.

### Accessing Prometheus UI

You can access to Prometheus expression browser by port-forwarding on port 9090:

```shell
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-k8s 9090:9090 --namespace monitoring
```

Now if you go to <http://127.0.0.1:9090> on your browser you can execute queries
and visualize query results.

### Service Monitoring

Target discovery is achieved via ServiceMonitor CRD, to learn more about
ServiceMonitor please follow Prometheus Operator's
[documentation](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/blob/master/Documentation/user-guides/running-exporters.md).

To learn how to create ServiceMonitor resources for your services please see the
[example][example].

### Prometheus Rules and Alerts

Alerting rules are created via PrometheusRule CRD, to learn more about
PrometheusRule please follow Prometheus Operator
[documentation](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/blob/master/Documentation/user-guides/alerting.md)
and Prometheus
[documentation](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/master/docs/configuration/alerting_rules.md).

To learn how to define alert rules for your services please see the
[example](../../examples/prometheus-rules).
