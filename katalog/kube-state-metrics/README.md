# Kube State Metrics

<!-- <SD-DOCS> -->

This package provides kube-state-metrics service which listens to Kubernetes API
server and generates metrics about the state of Kubernetes objects like
Deployments, Nodes, or Pods.

From kube-state-metrics
[repository](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics):

> That kube-state-metrics is about generating metrics from Kubernetes API
> objects without modification. This ensures, that features provided by
> kube-state-metrics have the same grade of stability as the Kubernetes API
> objects themselves. In turn, this means, that kube-state-metrics in certain
> situations may not show the same values as kubectl, as kubectl applies
> certain heuristics to display comprehensible messages. kube-state-metrics
> exposes raw data unmodified from the Kubernetes API, this way users have all
> the data they require and perform heuristics as they see fit.
