# Monitoring Module version 1.10.0

SIGHUP team maintains this module updated and tested. That is the main reason why we worked on this new release.
With the Kubernetes 1.19 release, it became the perfect time to start testing this module against this Kubernetes
release. Grafana Labs released a major release of its flagship product, Grafana 7. SIGHUP includes the latest Grafana
release in this Fury distribution core module. Alongside this major change, an extra interesting job has been developed.

## Upgrade path

This release includes a deep refactoring of the Grafana dashboards and Prometheus Operator Service Monitors objects.
Moved from all in one deployment *(all dashboards were shipped by default)* to just deploy those dashboards having
packages associated.
As an example, if you won't deploy [`goldpinger`](../../katalog/goldpinger)
you will not have its Grafana dashboard nor Prometheus Operator Service Monitor deployed.

To upgrade this core module from `v1.9.0` to `v1.10.0`, first, delete old resources before applying the new
`kustomize` project.

### Important note to Furyctl users

If you are using [furyctl](https://github.com/sighupio/furyctl) and `Furyfiles.yml`
you have to add a new entry in your `Furyfile.yml` file while deploying
Kubernetes platform `servicemonitors` like [kubeadm-sm](../../katalog/kubeadm-sm), [gke-sm](../../katalog/gke-sm)...:

**Before:**

```yaml
bases:
  - name: monitoring/kubeadm-sm # Same with gke-sm, aks-sm, kubeadm-sm
    version: v1.9.0
```
**After:**

```yaml
bases:
  - name: monitoring/kubeadm-sm # Same with gke-sm, aks-sm, kubeadm-sm
    version: v1.10.0
  - name: monitoring/configs # Same with gke-sm, aks-sm, kubeadm-sm
    version: v1.10.0
```
