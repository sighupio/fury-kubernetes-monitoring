# Monitoring Module version 1.10.3

`kubeadm` versions starting from `1.17` are not exposing `kube-controller-manager` nor `kube-scheduler` metrics
over the insecure port *(respectively TCP/10252 and TCP/10251)*.
This makes the current `ServiceMonitor` configuration unable to properly scrape these targets.
Also, there were duplicated Prometheus Rules across packages: `kubeadm-sm` and `prometheus-operated`.

Thanks to @lnovara to spot and solve these issues.

## Changelog

- FIX #51: `kubeadm-sm` package to proper configure `serviceMonitors` to solve `kubeadm` +1.17 versions.
- FIX: Remove duplicated prometheus rules:
  - `KubeClientCertificateExpiration`
  - `KubeSchedulerDown`
  - `KubeControllerManagerDown`

## Upgrade path

To upgrade this core module from `v1.10.2` to `v1.10.3`, you need to download this new version, then apply the
`kustomize` project. No further action is required.

```bash
kustomize build katalog/kubeadm-sm | kubectl apply -f -
kustomize build katalog/prometheus-operated | kubectl apply -f -
```
