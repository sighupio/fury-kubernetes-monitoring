- Since the release ships made changes in the architecture of `Thanos`, the upgrade process needs the deletion of all resources from the old version of the module.

```shell
kustomize build katalog/thanos -n monitoring | kubectl delete -f -
kustomize build katalog/thanos | kubectl apply -f - --server-side
