# Monitoring Module version 1.10.1

The previous 1.10.0 release includes a couple of issues in the Fury alerting stack.
This release solves these problems to maintain retro compatibility with previous alerting stack versions.

*Special thanks to @lnovara, @nutellinoit, and @lzecca78 to spot these problems!*

## Changelog

- Remove `CPUThrottlingHigh` as it was previously removed in #43.
- Rename `Watchdog` to `DeadMansSwitch` to maintain backward compatibility.

## Upgrade path

To upgrade this core module from `v1.10.0` to `v1.10.1`, you need to download this new version, then apply the
`kustomize` project. No further action is required.

```bash
kustomize build katalog/prometheus-operated | kubectl apply -f -
```
